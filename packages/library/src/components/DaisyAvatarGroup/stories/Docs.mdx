# DaisyAvatarGroup

<Meta of={PrimaryStory} />

An avatar group component. This component replicates the behavior of the avatar-group classin Daisy UI
that is documented in [Daisy UI Avatar component](https://daisyui.com/components/avatar/), but does not use the
avatar-group class itself to support masks for avatar components.
