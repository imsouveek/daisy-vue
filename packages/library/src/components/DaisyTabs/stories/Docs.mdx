# DaisyTabs

<Meta of={PrimaryStory} />

A tab component for displaying information in a tabbed format. This component
uses the [Daisy UI Tab component](https://daisyui.com/components/tab/) and exposes most of the
available options.

<div className="p-8 border-1 rounded border-gray-200 shadow-sm shadow-gray-200 dark:shadow-none dark:border-gray-800 dark:bg-slate-900">
    <Story of={PrimaryStory.Playground} />
</div>
<Source of={PrimaryStory.Playground} />

<Controls />

## Usage

The tabs can be visually styled through various properties

### Sizes

The size property controls the size of the tabs

<div className="p-8 border-1 rounded border-gray-200 shadow-sm shadow-gray-200 dark:shadow-none dark:border-gray-800 dark:bg-slate-900">
    <Story of={VariationsStories.Sizes} />
</div>

### Types

The type property controls the appearance of the tabs

<div className="p-8 border-1 rounded border-gray-200 shadow-sm shadow-gray-200 dark:shadow-none dark:border-gray-800 dark:bg-slate-900">
    <Story of={VariationsStories.Types} />
</div>

### Positions

The position property controls the placement of the tabs

**Note:** It is not supported to have nested tabs
with different positions explicitly defined. However, if outer tabs is not explicitly having position set and inner tabs
have position explicitly set as bottom, then we can have nested tabs with outer tabs positioned at top and inner tabs
positioned at bottom

<div className="p-8 border-1 rounded border-gray-200 shadow-sm shadow-gray-200 dark:shadow-none dark:border-gray-800 dark:bg-slate-900">
    <Story of={VariationsStories.Positions} />
</div>
